# Contribution Guidelines
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
2. Libraries that are PHP 5.3+, Composer-installable, PSR compliant, tested and documented are preferred.
3. Enter a meaningful pull request description.
4. Please make an individual commit for each suggestion in a pull request.
5. Put a link to each library in your pull request ticket so they're easier to look at.
6. Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
7. Prefix duplicate library names with their vendor or namespace followed by a space: Foo\Bar would be Foo Bar.
8. New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation, are always welcome.
9. Keep descriptions short and simple. 
10. End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
11. Check your spelling and grammar.
